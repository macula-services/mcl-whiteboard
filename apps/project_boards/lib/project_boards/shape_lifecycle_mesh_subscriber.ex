  # published by any peer hosting the same board_id (see
  # GuideBoardLifecycle.ShapeLifecycle.ShapeLifecycleV1ToMesh, the other
  # half of this pair -- its topics/0 is the one list both halves use). Replaces
  # BoardMeshSubscriber (stroke_drawn_v1's own topic) AND
  # ShapeMeshSubscriber (shape_mutated_v1's shared topic) -- same
  # collapse as ShapeLifecycleToBoardShapes on the local-projection side,
  # for the same reason: shape creation is one event type now, not four.
  #
  # Facts arrive as READ-ONLY: this writes straight into the ETS read
  # model and broadcasts locally exactly like the local
  # ShapeLifecycleToBoardShapes projection does, but it never dispatches
  # a command through this host's own aggregate. That is what keeps
  # replication loop-free -- a remote shape event never re-enters the
  # local evoq event log, so it can never trigger the mesh emitter again.
