  # Projects shape_initiated_v1/shape_amended_v1/shape_removed_v1 onto
  # the `board_shapes` ETS bag -- replaces StrokeDrawnV1ToBoardShapes AND
  # ShapeMutatedToBoardShapes, which each existed only because shape
  # creation used to be four separate event types (stroke_drawn_v1/
  # sticky_placed_v1/text_placed_v1/geometry_drawn_v1), each needing its
  # own per-kind field mapping (to_shape/2's own dispatch). Now that
  # every kind arrives through the SAME event with `kind` as data, that
  # whole dispatch collapses: the row is built directly off the event's
  # own fields, no per-kind branching left to get wrong.
  #
  # No more `stroke_id` field on the row either -- it was always exactly
  # equal to `shape_id` for a stroke (see the old Store module doc), and
  # nothing downstream (JS client, this app, query_boards) ever read it
  # as distinct from shape_id. Confirmed by grep before dropping it.
