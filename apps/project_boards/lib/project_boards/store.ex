defmodule ProjectBoards.Store do
  # ETS read-model facade, mirrors mcl-tube's project_tube_store pattern.
  # Owns four public named tables so projections and query_boards' desks
  # can read/write directly without routing every operation through this
  # process -- this process only exists to own the tables' lifetime.
  #
  # :boards              set  board_id => %{owner, title, status}
  # :board_shapes        bag  board_id => shape map (one entry per shape,
  #                           any kind -- stroke/sticky/text/geometry)
  # :board_shapes_seen   set  shape_id => true
  # :board_shape_versions set board_id => latest applied shape_initiated_v1's evoq version
  #
  # board_shapes_seen exists purely for :ets.insert_new/2's atomic
  # check-and-set -- shape_id is globally random (DrawStrokeV1.random_id/0
  # and its siblings, not board-scoped), so one flat set covers every board
  # AND every shape kind. Without it, evoq's catchup replay on restart
  # re-delivers a host's full local history through the same handle_event
  # path (see ShapeLifecycleToBoardShapes and ShapeLifecycleMeshSubscriber,
  # the two writers), which re-broadcasts every historical shape to any
  # currently-connected LiveView -- board_shapes itself mostly self-heals
  # (a bag won't store a second identical tuple), but the broadcast has no
  # such guard and isn't a table operation, so it happened on every
  # redelivery regardless.
  #
  # board_shape_versions backs join_board's as_of_version (see
  # QueryBoards.GetBoardSnapshotByIdOverMesh) -- evoq hands every projection
  # handler the wrapped event's own top-level `version`, so this just
  # remembers the highest one genuinely applied per board_id. It only needs
  # to track shape_initiated_v1 versions specifically: as_of_version exists
  # so a joining client can drop already-applied shape_initiated_v1 events
  # out of whatever it buffered from the live mesh subscription during the
  # join round trip, and shape_initiated_v1 is the only event type that
  # subscription carries (renamed from board_stroke_versions/
  # note_stroke_version/stroke_version -- was stroke-only from before
  # shape_initiated_v1 unified all four creation event types).
