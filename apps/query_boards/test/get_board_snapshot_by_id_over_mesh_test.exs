  # Regression for a real bug found live 2026-08-25: normalize_shape/1 was
  # normalize_stroke/1, extracting only stroke_id/points/color/width --
  # correct back when a snapshot's `shapes` list held nothing but strokes,
  # silently wrong once sticky/text/geometry shapes existed. Every
  # non-stroke shape lost its kind/shape_id/text (replaced with a
  # stroke_id that never existed for it, always nil). Now that
  # shape_initiated_v1 unified shape creation, no row carries a
  # `stroke_id` field at all -- normalize_shape/1 no longer produces one.
