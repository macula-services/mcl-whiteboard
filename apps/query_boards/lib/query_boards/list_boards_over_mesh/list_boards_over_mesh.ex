  # Client half of the mesh-aware board picker. Unlike
  # GetBoardSnapshotByIdOverMesh (join_board's query, which stops at the
  # first authoritative reply), a board-list query has no single correct
  # answerer -- every node that hosts something may reply -- so this
  # collects for a FIXED WINDOW instead of stopping early, then merges
  # what came back. The query carries a fresh request_id and every host
  # replies on the one fixed reply topic, echoing it; ManyShotMeshReply
  # keeps only replies to this request.
  #
  # Meant to run off the LiveView's main process (see
  # MclWhiteboardWeb.BoardsLive's use of start_async/3) -- this
  # function blocks its caller for up to timeout_ms, which would freeze
  # a LiveView's own mailbox for that whole window if called directly
  # from mount/handle_event.
