defmodule TrackPresence.Roster do
  # ETS-backed presence roster -- one row per {board_id, peer_id}, holding
  # where that peer's cursor last came to rest. Deliberately NOT
  # event-sourced (see the README's "Presence is not event-sourced"
  # decision): this is ephemeral session state, aged
  # out by Sweep, never written to the event store. The one exception
  # (leave_board -> peer_departed_v1) lives in guide_board_lifecycle, not
  # here -- this module only owns the roster and the mesh-wide "here's
  # where I am" fact.
  #
  # touch/1 is for a LOCALLY-originated fact -- either a real settle
  # (this node's own LiveView calling in after its JS hook debounced a
  # pointer stop) or a join-time registration at mount with x/y left nil
  # (BoardLive.render_board/4 -- see its own comment for why the picker's
  # presence count needs this). Either way it writes the row, broadcasts
  # locally, AND publishes to mesh. absorb_remote/1 is for a fact
  # arriving FROM the mesh -- writes the row and broadcasts locally only,
  # never re-publishes. That asymmetry is what keeps this loop-free, same
  # trick ShapeLifecycleMeshSubscriber uses for shapes.
