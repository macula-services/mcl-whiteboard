  # AnswerDrawStrokeRequests for the write-relay this enables. Renaming
  # a remote board isn't built; broadening can_draw? without a matching
  # can_rename? would have silently done that by accident.

  # Derived from this node's own identity (Node.self()) rather than one
  # literal shared across the whole fleet -- a single hardcoded id here
  # meant every node that couldn't reach the real host over the mesh in
  # time (find_or_host_default_board/0's :not_found fallback) silently
  # minted its OWN independent board under the SAME id, so beam01, beam02
  # and msi00 ended up with three different boards answering to one
  # board_id (found live 2026-08-26, see CHANGELOG). Node.self() is fixed
  # per deployed node (distinct mcl_whiteboard@<host> per fleet box,
  # :nonode@nohost for local dev), so this is still stable across restarts
  # -- it just no longer collides across nodes.
  #

  # documented in this repo's own plan doc ({:invalid_stream_id, ...},
  # reckon_db_stream_path:id_nodes/1 crash-looping the store's gateway
