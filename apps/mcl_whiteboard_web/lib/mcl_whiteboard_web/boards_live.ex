  # than inside ListBoardsOverMesh itself, since every other query module
  # in this app (GetBoardSnapshotByIdOverMesh included) fails fast on
  # purpose and leaves retry policy to the caller -- this keeps that
  # convention intact instead of quietly changing what `call/1` means for
  # every caller. `remote_boards_loading?` is deliberately left alone
  # here (still `true` from mount) rather than flipped to `false`: this
